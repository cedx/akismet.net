# Submit Ham
This call is intended for the submission of false positives - items that were incorrectly classified as spam by Akismet.
It takes identical arguments as [comment check](CommentCheck.md) and [submit spam](SubmitSpam.md).

Remember that, as explained in the [submit spam](SubmitSpam.md) documentation, you should ensure
that any values you're passing here match up with the original and corresponding [comment check](CommentCheck.md) call.

See the [Akismet API documentation](https://akismet.com/developers/detailed-docs/submit-ham-false-positives) for more information.

## .NET/C#
```cs
Task Client.SubmitHam(Comment comment, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
```

### Parameters

#### Comment **comment**
The user's `Comment` to be submitted, incorrectly classified as spam.

> [!NOTE]
> Ideally, it should be the same object as the one passed to the original [comment check](CommentCheck.md) API call.

#### CancellationToken **cancellationToken**
The token to cancel the operation.

### Return value
A `Task` that completes when the given `Comment` has been submitted.

The task faults with a `HttpRequestException` when an issue occurs.
The exception `Message` usually includes some debug information, provided by the `X-akismet-debug-help` HTTP header,
about what exactly was invalid about the call.

It can also fault with a custom error message (provided by the `X-akismet-alert-msg` header).
See [Response Error Codes](https://akismet.com/developers/detailed-docs/errors) for more information.

```cs
using Belin.Akismet;
using System;

  };

  var comment = new Comment(author) { Content = "I'm testing out the Service API." };
  var client = new Client("123YourAPIKey", "https://www.yourblog.com");
  await client.SubmitHam(comment);

  Console.WriteLine("The comment was successfully submitted as ham.");
}
catch (HttpRequestException e) {
  Console.Error.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {e.Message}");
}
```
